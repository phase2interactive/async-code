# Task ID: 2
# Title: Remove Container Privileged Access
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Eliminate privileged Docker container execution to prevent container escape vulnerabilities
# Details:
Successfully removed all privileged Docker container execution. Updated Docker container configurations to run as non-root user with --user 1000:1000. Removed --privileged flag from docker run commands in both code_task_v1.py and code_task_v2.py. Eliminated host PID namespace access (pid_mode: 'host'). Removed all Linux capabilities (cap_add: ['ALL']). Removed permissive security options (seccomp=unconfined, apparmor=unconfined). Created dedicated non-root user in both Dockerfile.claude-automation and Dockerfile.codex-automation. Added security option no-new-privileges=true to prevent privilege escalation. Removed environment variables related to sandbox bypass (CODEX_UNSAFE_ALLOW_NO_SANDBOX, etc.). Created comprehensive test scripts to verify security restrictions and AI functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Security tests verify containers cannot access host resources and run as non-root user. Functional tests confirm AI agents still work properly. All tests pass successfully.
