# Task ID: 2
# Title: Remove Container Privileged Access
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Eliminate privileged Docker container execution to prevent container escape vulnerabilities
# Details:
Update Docker container configurations to run as non-root user. Remove --privileged flag from docker run commands. Implement proper user mapping with --user flag. Create dedicated non-root user in container images. Remove host PID namespace access.

# Test Strategy:
Security tests to verify containers cannot access host resources, functional tests to ensure AI agents still work properly
