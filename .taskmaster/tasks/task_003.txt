# Task ID: 3
# Title: Fix Command Injection Vulnerabilities
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement proper input sanitization and command escaping to prevent remote code execution
# Details:
Use subprocess with shell=False and proper argument lists. Implement input validation using Pydantic models. Add whitelist validation for allowed commands. Use shlex.quote() for shell escaping when necessary. Replace string concatenation with parameterized commands.

# Test Strategy:
Security penetration tests with malicious payloads, unit tests for input validation functions, integration tests for command execution
