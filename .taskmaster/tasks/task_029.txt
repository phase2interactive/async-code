# Task ID: 29
# Title: Add Integration Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 24
# Priority: low
# Description: Create end-to-end integration tests for critical user workflows
# Details:
Use Playwright for E2E testing. Use test user account. 
Create test scenarios for complete task workflows. 
Add database seeding for test data. 
Implement test environment setup/teardown. 
Add visual regression testing.



Minimum Test Scenarios for Critical User Workflows

  Based on the async-code application, here are the critical path test scenarios we need to cover:

  1. Authentication Flow (Critical)

  - Sign In: User can sign in with valid credentials
  - Sign Out: User can sign out successfully
  - Protected Routes: Unauthenticated users are redirected to sign-in

  2. Task Creation and Execution (Critical)

  - Create Task: User can create a new AI coding task
  - View Task Progress: User can see real-time task execution status
  - View Task Results: User can see completed task results and diffs

  3. Project Management (Important)

  - Create Project: User can create a new project with GitHub repository
  - View Projects: User can see their list of projects

  4. GitHub Integration (Critical for Task Execution)

  - Set GitHub Token: User can set their GitHub token in settings
  - Clone Repository: System can clone repository for task execution

  5. Basic Navigation (Smoke Tests)

  - Navigate Between Pages: User can navigate between main pages
  - Responsive UI: Key workflows work on mobile viewport

  Test Implementation Strategy

  Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

  1. Set up Playwright with TypeScript
  2. Create test database seeding utilities
  3. Set up test environment configuration

  Phase 2: Critical Path Tests

  1. Authentication flow (sign in/out, protected routes)
  2. Task creation and viewing results
  3. GitHub token configuration

  Phase 3: Extended Tests (if time permits)

  1. Project management
  2. Multiple concurrent tasks
  3. Error scenarios

  Key Test Principles

  - Fast: Tests should run quickly (< 5 minutes total)
  - Reliable: No flaky tests - use proper waits and assertions
  - Independent: Each test should be self-contained
  - Maintainable: Use Page Object Model pattern

# Test Strategy:
E2E test coverage for critical paths, test reliability and flakiness monitoring, cross-browser testing
