# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Container Security Policies
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Add seccomp and AppArmor security policies to restrict container capabilities
# Details:
Create custom seccomp profiles restricting system calls. Implement AppArmor profiles for container isolation. Add resource limits (CPU, memory, disk). Remove Docker socket mounting. Use read-only root filesystem where possible.

# Test Strategy:
Security tests for policy enforcement, functional tests to ensure AI agents work within constraints, performance tests for resource limits
