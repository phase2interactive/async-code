Based on your current setup and 2025 trends, here
  are tools worth considering:

  1. State Management: Zustand

  Replace Context API for complex state. Your auth
  context and task polling would benefit from
  Zustand's cleaner API:
  - 50% less boilerplate than Context
  - Built-in devtools
  - Better performance (no unnecessary re-renders)

  2. Data Fetching: TanStack Query

  Perfect for your API calls and real-time polling:
  - Automatic caching & background refetching
  - Replace manual polling logic
  - Built-in error/loading states
  - Works great with Supabase

  3. Form Handling: React Hook Form

  For settings and task creation forms:
  - Better performance than controlled inputs
  - Built-in validation
  - Works well with TypeScript

  4. Animation: Motion (Framer Motion v12)

  For task status transitions and UI feedback:
  - Smooth transitions for your diff viewer
  - Loading states and progress indicators
  - Minimal bundle size impact

  5. Testing: Vitest + Testing Library

  Modern alternative to Jest:
  - 10x faster test runs
  - Native ESM support
  - Same API as Jest
