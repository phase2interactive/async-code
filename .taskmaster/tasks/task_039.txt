# Task ID: 39
# Title: Create Test Environment Setup Scripts
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 34, 35, 37
# Priority: high
# Description: **CRITICAL FOR SYSTEM STABILITY** - Build automated scripts for complete test environment initialization and configuration. This ensures consistent test environments and prevents setup-related failures.
# Details:
Create setup-test-env.sh script that: starts Docker containers, runs database migrations, executes seed scripts, creates test users, and validates environment. Include teardown-test-env.sh for cleanup. Add environment validation checks. Support both local development and CI environments. Include error handling and rollback. This is critical for maintaining consistent test environments across all development stages.

# Test Strategy:
Test complete setup and teardown cycles. Verify environment validation. Test error scenarios and rollback. Validate script idempotency. Test in both local and CI environments.
