# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement JWT-based Authentication System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace the vulnerable X-User-ID header authentication with secure JWT-based authentication
# Details:
Create JWT token generation and validation middleware. Implement token refresh mechanism. Remove X-User-ID header dependency. Use libraries like PyJWT for Python backend and jose for frontend. Store tokens securely in httpOnly cookies or secure localStorage with proper expiration.
