# Task ID: 40
# Title: Implement Row-Level Security for Test Data
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 32, 37
# Priority: high
# Description: **CRITICAL FOR SYSTEM STABILITY** - Configure database RLS policies to ensure complete isolation of test data from production. This is essential for preventing data contamination and security breaches.
# Details:
Create RLS policies for users, projects, tasks, and repositories tables. Implement test_mode column or user role-based filtering. Ensure test users can only access test data. Create database functions: is_test_user(user_id), enable_test_mode(), disable_test_mode(). Include migration scripts for RLS setup. This is critical for maintaining data integrity and security between test and production environments.

# Test Strategy:
Test data isolation between test and production users. Verify RLS policy enforcement. Test policy bypass scenarios. Validate migration scripts. Test with different user roles and permissions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Database Schema Analysis and RLS Policy Design [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze existing database schema to identify security requirements, data relationships, and design comprehensive RLS policy architecture for multi-tenant data isolation
### Details:
Review current table structures, foreign key relationships, user roles, and data access patterns. Design RLS policy framework including tenant isolation strategies, user permission models, and security boundaries. Document policy hierarchy and interaction patterns.

## 2. Test Mode Column and Role-Based Filtering Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.1
### Description: Implement test_mode column infrastructure and role-based filtering mechanisms to support development and production data separation
### Details:
Add test_mode columns to relevant tables, create role-based access control system, implement filtering logic for test vs production data, and establish user role hierarchy with appropriate permissions.

## 3. RLS Policies for Core Tables Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.1, 40.2
### Description: Create and implement RLS policies for users, projects, tasks, and repositories tables with proper tenant isolation and access controls
### Details:
Develop specific RLS policies for each core table ensuring proper data isolation, implement row-level security rules based on user ownership and permissions, create policies for read/write operations, and establish cross-table relationship security.

## 4. Database Functions for Test User Identification and Mode Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.2
### Description: Develop database functions to identify test users, manage test modes, and handle security context switching
### Details:
Create PL/pgSQL functions for test user identification, implement mode switching mechanisms, develop security context management functions, and create helper functions for policy evaluation and debugging.

## 5. Migration Scripts for RLS Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.3, 40.4
### Description: Create comprehensive migration scripts to enable RLS, apply policies, and handle data migration with zero downtime
### Details:
Develop migration scripts for enabling RLS on tables, applying policies in correct order, handling existing data migration, creating rollback procedures, and ensuring zero-downtime deployment with proper backup strategies.

## 6. Policy Testing and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.5
### Description: Implement comprehensive testing framework for RLS policies including unit tests, integration tests, and security validation
### Details:
Create test suites for each RLS policy, implement automated security testing, develop test scenarios for various user roles and permissions, create performance testing for policy overhead, and establish continuous security validation processes.

## 7. Security Audit and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.6
### Description: Conduct thorough security audit of RLS implementation and create comprehensive documentation for maintenance and compliance
### Details:
Perform security audit of all RLS policies and implementations, document security architecture and policy decisions, create operational runbooks for RLS management, establish monitoring and alerting for security violations, and prepare compliance documentation.
