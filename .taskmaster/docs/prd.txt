# Async Code - Multi-Agent Code Task Management System
Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Async Code is a multi-agent code task management system that allows users to create, manage, and execute AI-powered coding tasks. The system orchestrates multiple AI agents (Claude Code and Codex) running in isolated Docker containers to work on software development tasks autonomously.

## Current State & Critical Issues

The system is currently deployed but has severe security vulnerabilities that must be addressed before any new features are developed:

1. **Authentication Bypass**: The system accepts unverified user IDs, allowing complete user impersonation
2. **Container Escape Risk**: Docker containers run with privileged access, allowing root access to host
3. **Command Injection**: User prompts are inadequately escaped, allowing remote code execution
4. **Exposed Secrets**: Service keys and tokens are hardcoded and stored in plaintext

## System Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)
- Task management UI for creating and monitoring AI coding tasks
- Project organization and task grouping
- Code diff visualization using CodeMirror
- Supabase authentication integration
- Real-time task status updates

### Backend API (Flask + Python)
- RESTful API for task and project management
- Docker container orchestration for AI agents
- Git repository integration
- Task execution monitoring and result storage
- Database operations with Supabase

### AI Agent Execution
- Containerized execution environment for each task
- Support for multiple AI models (Claude Code, Codex)
- Automatic repository cloning and branch management
- Change tracking and patch generation
- Chat history and progress logging

## Critical Security Requirements (Phase 1 - Immediate)

### Authentication System Overhaul
- Implement JWT-based authentication with proper validation
- Remove X-User-ID header vulnerability
- Add comprehensive auth middleware to all endpoints
- Update frontend to use secure authentication tokens
- Implement proper error handling for auth failures

### Container Security Hardening
- Remove privileged container access
- Implement proper security policies (seccomp, AppArmor)
- Remove host PID namespace access
- Prevent Docker socket mounting in containers
- Add resource limits and isolation

### Input Validation & Injection Prevention
- Fix command injection vulnerabilities in shell command execution
- Implement comprehensive input validation using Pydantic
- Add proper escaping for all user inputs
- Validate and sanitize all API parameters

### Secrets Management
- Remove all hardcoded secrets from codebase
- Implement encrypted storage for GitHub tokens
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Add secrets rotation capability

## High Priority Security Requirements (Phase 2)

### API Security
- Implement rate limiting (10 tasks/hour, 100 API calls/minute)
- Fix CORS configuration to prevent wildcard subdomain matching
- Add CSRF protection to all state-changing operations
- Implement XSS protection for user-generated content

### Security Infrastructure
- Add comprehensive security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Implement structured logging for security events
- Add monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities
- Create security audit trail

## Core Functional Requirements (Phase 3)

### Task Management
- Create and store AI coding tasks with metadata
- Execute tasks in isolated Docker containers

- Support multiple repositories per project
- Project templates and presets

## Quality Requirements (Phase 4)

### Testing & Reliability
- Achieve 80% code coverage with unit tests
- Implement integration tests for critical paths
- Add end-to-end tests for user workflows
- Security-focused test suite

### Code Quality
- Refactor large files (>1000 lines) into modules
- Implement consistent error handling
- Add comprehensive type hints
- Follow PEP8 and ESLint standards

### Performance
- Optimize frontend rendering and state management
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Add pagination for large datasets
- Minimize container startup time

### Documentation

- Add inline code documentation
- Create user guides and tutorials
- Document deployment procedures

## Technical Constraints

### Infrastructure
- Docker daemon required for container operations
- Supabase for database and authentication
- Support for Linux environments
- Minimum 4GB RAM per container

### Security
- All containers must run as non-root users
- Network isolation between containers
- No direct host filesystem access
- Audit logging for all operations

### Scalability
- Support up to 5 concurrent tasks per user
- Handle 100+ active users
- Container pool management
- Queue system for task scheduling

## Success Metrics

### Security
- Zero authentication bypass vulnerabilities
- No container escape possibilities
- Pass security audit and penetration testing
- Compliance with OWASP Top 10

### Performance
- Task creation < 2 seconds
- Container startup < 30 seconds
- Frontend load time < 3 seconds
- 99.9% API availability
