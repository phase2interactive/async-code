Okay, let's compare the E2B implementation I outlined conceptually in the previous response (let's call it "Conceptual E2B Refactor") with the actual E2B implementation you've provided in the new file listing (primarily in utils/code_task_e2b.py and utils/code_task_e2b_real.py).
Your Provided E2B Implementation (Key Features):
Dispatcher Logic: utils/code_task_e2b.py correctly checks for E2B_API_KEY and dispatches to _real_run_ai_code_task_e2b from utils/code_task_e2b_real.py if present, otherwise runs a local simulation using subprocess.
Async Runner: utils/async_runner.py is implemented to bridge Flask's sync nature with E2B's async SDK.
Real E2B Execution (code_task_e2b_real.py):
Uses e2b.Sandbox.create() to instantiate sandboxes.
Passes GITHUB_TOKEN and AI API keys as environment variables to the sandbox.
Performs git clone and git config using sandbox.process.start_and_wait().
Agent Execution:
Claude: Installs @anthropic-ai/claude-cli globally via npm and then runs claude "{prompt}".
Codex: Installs openai via pip, writes a Python script to /tmp/codex_agent.py, and then executes that script.
Captures git status, git diff, git rev-parse HEAD, and git format-patch using sandbox.process.start_and_wait().
Updates the database with results.
Includes timeout handling for various stages (sandbox lifetime, clone, agent, commands).
Includes error handling for E2B quota, API key issues, GitHub auth, and general exceptions.
Ensures sandbox is closed in a finally block.
Simulation Mode (code_task_e2b.py -> simulate_ai_execution):
Creates a temporary local directory.
Uses local subprocess to run git commands.
Simulates AI execution by creating/modifying AI_GENERATED.md.
Extracts git diff, patch, commit hash.
Task Parameter Fetching: Both the dispatcher and the real E2B function fetch full task details from the database if not all primary parameters (repo_url, branch, prompt, model) are passed in.
Error Sanitization: Redacts github_token from error messages.
Diff Parsing: parse_file_changes is present in both code_task_e2b_real.py and code_task_e2b.py.
Comparison: Your Implementation vs. Conceptual E2B Refactor
Let's see what the conceptual refactor suggested and how your implementation aligns or differs:
Core E2B SDK Usage:
Conceptual: Suggested using Sandbox() and sandbox.run_code() or sandbox.commands.run().
Yours: Uses await Sandbox.create() and sandbox.process.start_and_wait() for shell commands, and for Codex, writes a Python script then runs it with sandbox.process.start_and_wait("python ...").
Analysis: Your approach using sandbox.process.start_and_wait() is perfectly valid and often simpler for direct command execution. The conceptual sandbox.run_code() is more for when you want to run Python code directly and get structured results from Python objects (like charts from matplotlib). Since your core logic involves running git and existing CLIs, process.start_and_wait is appropriate.
Missing/Different from Conceptual (Minor): The conceptual one proposed an E2B_SCRIPT_TEMPLATE (a single large Python script run by sandbox.run_python()). Your code_task_e2b_real.py orchestrates a sequence of shell commands using sandbox.process.start_and_wait() and a small Python script for Codex. Both are valid strategies. Orchestrating with multiple start_and_wait calls gives fine-grained control and error checking at each step. A single large script might be simpler to write but harder to debug step-by-step if something goes wrong inside. Your approach is more robust for sequential shell commands.
Agent CLI Handling:
Conceptual: Highlighted the need to make CLIs available in E2B, suggesting custom templates or on-the-fly installation.
Yours: Implements on-the-fly installation for both Claude CLI (npm) and OpenAI SDK (pip).
Analysis: This works but, as predicted, is inefficient for repeated task executions. Custom E2B templates are the recommended optimization here.
Match: Your implementation directly addresses how to run these agents.
Script Generation for E2B:
Conceptual: Suggested replacing create_safe_docker_script with a new Python script for E2B.
Yours:
For general git operations and Claude CLI, you're essentially sending individual commands, not one big script.
For Codex, you dynamically generate a small Python script (script = f'''...''') and write it to /tmp/codex_agent.py inside the sandbox.
Analysis: Your approach for Codex matches the spirit of the conceptual idea of running a Python script. For Claude and git, individual commands are fine. The old create_safe_docker_script is indeed no longer relevant in the E2B context.
Output Parsing:
Conceptual: Noted that E2B returns structured results, but for git diff etc., you'd still capture stdout.
Yours: Correctly captures stdout from git diff, git format-patch, etc. The parse_file_changes function is used for generating the detailed file changes for the UI.
Analysis: This aligns well. The old Docker log parsing is gone, replaced by direct stdout capture.
Async Handling:
Conceptual: Didn't explicitly provide AsyncRunner but acknowledged the need.
Yours: utils/async_runner.py is implemented, which is excellent. run_async_task is used in code_task_e2b_real.py's synchronous wrapper run_ai_code_task_e2b.
Analysis: This is a very good and necessary addition for integrating the async E2B SDK with sync Flask.
Configuration and Environment:
Conceptual: Suggested adding E2B_API_KEY and removing Docker configs.
Yours: .env.example correctly includes E2B_API_KEY. Your env_config.py still contains Docker-related configs (CONTAINER_UID, etc.). These are now dead code and should be removed to avoid confusion. The config.py also re-exports them.
Missing/Needs Action: Clean up unused Docker-related configurations from env_config.py and config.py.
Error Handling and Timeouts:
Conceptual: General mention.
Yours: code_task_e2b_real.py has good specific timeout constants and error handling for E2B sandbox creation and process execution, including asyncio.TimeoutError. This is robust.
Analysis: Your implementation is more detailed and practical here.
What Might Be Missing or Needs Further Consideration from Your Implementation (Compared to General Best Practices or Potential Issues):
Custom E2B Templates (Efficiency):
Crucial Point from Previous Review: Your current method of npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-cli and pip install openai inside each sandbox for every task is highly inefficient.
Action: Define an e2b.Dockerfile for a custom sandbox template that pre-installs git, nodejs, npm, @anthropic-ai/claude-cli, and python3-pip (then pip install openai). Build this template using e2b template build and then use await Sandbox.create(template='your-custom-template-id', ...) in code_task_e2b_real.py. This will dramatically improve task startup time and reduce costs.
Your top-level Dockerfile installs @anthropic-ai/sdk globally. This is for the Flask app itself, NOT the E2B sandbox environment where the agent code runs. The sandbox is a separate, fresh environment each time unless you use a custom template.
Claude CLI Prompt Injection Risk:
In _run_claude_agent: f'cd /workspace/repo && claude "{prompt}"'
If prompt contains double quotes or other shell metacharacters (e.g., "; rm -rf /), it could break the command or lead to injection within the E2B sandbox's shell. While E2B isolates the sandbox, an injection inside it can still disrupt your task.
Action: The safest way is to write the prompt to a file within the sandbox and have the claude CLI read from that file (e.g., claude -f /tmp/prompt.txt).
# In _run_claude_agent
prompt_file_path = "/tmp/agent_prompt.txt"
await sandbox.filesystem.write(prompt_file_path, prompt)
claude_result = await asyncio.wait_for(
    sandbox.process.start_and_wait(
        f'cd /workspace/repo && claude --prompt-file {prompt_file_path}' # Assuming claude-cli supports this
    ),
    timeout=self.AGENT_TIMEOUT
)
# or if it only takes stdin:
# claude_process = await sandbox.process.start(
#    f'cd /workspace/repo && claude --read-stdin' # Fictional flag
# )
# await claude_process.send_stdin(prompt)
# claude_result = await claude_process.wait()
Use code with caution.
Python
If claude-cli doesn't support reading from a file or stdin directly for the main prompt, you might need to escape the prompt string very carefully before embedding it in the command. shlex.quote() could be run inside the sandbox using a small Python helper if needed, or you can implement robust escaping before forming the command string.
Codex Agent Script Complexity:
The Python script generated for the Codex agent is simple. If it needs to become more complex (e.g., interact with files based on the prompt, make multiple LLM calls), managing it as an inline f-string will become cumbersome.
Consideration: For more complex agent logic, have a predefined Python script file in your project, upload it to the sandbox using sandbox.filesystem.write(), and then execute it. The prompt can be passed as an environment variable or written to a temporary file that the script reads.
Sequential Codex Queue (utils/__init__.py):
You've kept the codex_execution_queue. Is this still necessary? E2B sandboxes are isolated. If this queue was to prevent local Docker resource exhaustion, it's likely not needed with E2B. If it's to rate-limit calls to the OpenAI API from within the sandboxes (if many tasks run concurrently), then it might still serve a purpose, but it's a global lock on your Flask app for any Codex task.
Action: Evaluate if this queue is still strictly required. If so, document why (e.g., "Codex API rate limits").
Unused Docker Configurations:
Files like utils/container.py, utils/secure_exec.py (most of it), and Docker-related settings in env_config.py/config.py are now obsolete.
Action: Remove them to clean up the codebase. utils/code_task_v1.py and utils/code_task_v2.py (the old Docker-based ones) can also be removed.
parse_file_changes Duplication:
This function exists in both utils/code_task_e2b.py and utils/code_task_e2b_real.py.
Action: Consolidate into a common utility location (e.g., a new utils/git_utils.py or keep it in one of the code_task_e2b*.py files and import).
Task Argument Passing to run_ai_code_task_e2b:
As noted before, tasks.py passes many arguments explicitly. run_ai_code_task_e2b in utils/code_task_e2b.py has logic to fetch them if not provided. This fallback logic seems mostly unused if tasks.py is the only caller.
Action: Simplify by either removing the fallback DB fetch in utils/code_task_e2b.py or changing tasks.py to only pass task_id, user_id, github_token. The latter is cleaner.
Conclusion of Comparison:
Your actual implementation is quite good and covers many necessary aspects of a real-world E2B integration, including robust error handling and the async bridge. It's more detailed and practical than the initial conceptual refactor in areas like specific command execution and timeout management.
The primary "missing" piece from the conceptual advice that would significantly benefit your current code is the use of custom E2B templates to avoid repeated dependency installations. The prompt injection concern for the Claude CLI is also a notable point to address for robustness. The cleanup of now-obsolete Docker-related code will also improve maintainability.
Overall, you're on the right track. The current structure is functional and the transition to E2B is well-managed by the dispatcher. The suggested actions are mostly optimizations and robustness improvements rather than fundamental flaws.
